        <p>Welcome to my GitHub page. On GitHub, I host some of my projects, most of them created in the <a href="http://www.raumzeitlabor.de/" target="_blank">RaumZeitLabor</a>, a hackerspace in Mannheim, Germany.</p>
		<p>For more information about those projects, keep reading of just have a look at the individual repositories, which you can find on my <a href="https://github.com/tiefpunkt/">Profile</a></p>
		<p>For more information on me, just have a look at my website, which you can find over at <a href="http://tiefpunkt.com">tiefpunkt.com</a></p>
		
		<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
		
		<h3>VPNmon</h3>
		<p>I run a small VPN service based on OpenVPN for a number of friends. After a while, I was curious as to how much data everyone transfers across that VPN. Looking for a webbased tool to monitor those VPN tunnels, I couldn't find any. That was when I started to build VPNmon.</p>
		<p>VPNmon is written in PHP and built on top of the Symfony Framework. It enables you to monitor multiple VPN servers running on the same machine, and can give you information about currently logged on users, and also past VPN sessions and summaries thereof.</p>
		<p>A number of extensions is planned, and will be added as time permits. If you want to contribute, or have some wishes as to which functions you want to have implemented, hit up the <a href="https://github.com/tiefpunkt/VPNmon">GitHub Repository</a> and let me know.</p>
		
		<h3>MokuWiki</h3>
		<p>MokuWiki is a wiki based on javascript and able to run without any kind of webserver, but just on your local machine.</p>
		<p>I wanted to be able to maintain a wiki on my laptop, without having to be connected to the internet. I didn't want to run a webserver just for that, since it would interfere with the development work I have to do. I did not want a desktop app, but something that feels like I'm working online. And I still wanted to be able to edit pages with my text editor.</p>
		<p>If you feel the same way, have a look at my work and feel free to contribute:<br /> <a href="http://tiefpunkt.github.com/MokuWiki">Project Homepage</a> | <a href="https://github.com/tiefpunkt/MokuWiki">GitHub Repository</a></p>
		
		<h3>TiddlyIO</h3>
		<p>For MokuWiki, I needed to access files on the local machine with JavaScript. TiddlyWiki does this, so I started building a library around their functionality.</p>
		<p>Feel free to use this library for your projects and contribute back to it:<br /> <a href="https://github.com/tiefpunkt/tiddlyIO">GitHub Repository</a></p>
		
		<h3>github-img-badge</h3>
		<p>The GitHub-Image-Badge is a php script which creates an image similar to the output of the <a href="https://github.com/heipei/github-commit-badge">github-commit-badge</a>. Usefull to integrate in forums etc., where JavaScript or even plain HTML is not allowed, but images are.</p>
