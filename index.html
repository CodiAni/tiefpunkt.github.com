        <p>Welcome to my GitHub page. On GitHub, I host some of my projects, most of them created in the <a href="http://www.raumzeitlabor.de/" target="_blank">RaumZeitLabor</a>, a hackerspace in Mannheim, Germany.</p>
		<p>For more information about those projects, keep reading of just have a look at the individual repositories, which you can find on my <a href="https://github.com/tiefpunkt/">Profile</a></p>
		<p>For more information on me, just have a look at my website, which you can find over at <a href="http://tiefpunkt.com">tiefpunkt.com</a></p>
		
		<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
		
		<h3>JSwiki</h3>
		<p>JSwiki is (going to be) a wiki based on javascript and able to run without any kind of webserver, but just on your local machine.</p>
		<p>I wanted to be able to maintain a wiki on my laptop, without having to be connected to the internet. I didn't want to run a webserver just for that, since it would interfere with the development work I have to do. I did not want a desktop app, but something that feels like I work online. And I still wanted to be able to edit pages with my text editor.</p>
		<p>If you feel the same way, have a look at my work and feel free to contribute: <a href="https://github.com/tiefpunkt/JSwiki">GitHub Repository</a></p>
		
		<h3>TiddlyIO</h3>
		<p>For JSwiki, I needed to access files on the local machine with JavaScript. TiddlyWiki does this, so I started building a library around their functionality.</p>
		<p>Feel free to use this library for your projects and contribute back to it: <a href="https://github.com/tiefpunkt/tiddlyIO">GitHub Repository</a></p>
		
		<h3>github-img-badge</h3>
		<p>The GitHub-Image-Badge is a php script which creates an image similar to the output of the <a href="https://github.com/heipei/github-commit-badge">github-commit-badge</a>. Usefull to integrate in forums etc., where JavaScript or even plain HTML is not allowed, but images are.</p>
